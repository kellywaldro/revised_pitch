# Jupyter Notebooks
Please submit a coherent, readable notebook (see `analysis.ipynb`) that walks Dhrumil and Aishi through the exploratory data analysis and regression analysis you've done in pursuit of your story.

This notebook should be clean and focused:

- move any code for data acquisition or scraping into it's own notebook with a name like `scraping.ipynb`
- move any code for data cleaning and maniupualtion into it's own notebook with a name like `cleaning.ipynb`
- you may even want to make a notebook called `scratchpad.ipynb` to keep your messy analysis, you can carefully move the relevant parts to `analysis.ipynb` and make sure it's written in such a way that Dhrumil and Aishi can follow your logic
    - add text to guide a reader through this notebook, you may want to use [markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to help organize your thoguhts.
- make sure `analysis.ipynb` runs (restart and run all cells) from top to bottom without errors
